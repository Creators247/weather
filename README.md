# My Weather App
This a website that get the location of a place 
Its first gets the country location  of the user and then uses this information to display details about the location
And it does this by making fetch request to an online api sever {weather api} and using its data
Its also changes the images based om the imputed location although the images might not be correct as they are only random
If location imputed cannot be found the weather forecast returns to the default location of the user & if the user didn't give the website access to his/her location at the open of the webpage, the weather forecast returns location to "Nigeria" as default
